# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction 
# Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting

This project analyzes Indian stock market data using machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast stock prices and cluster stocks based on technical indicators. The project includes visualization, regression models, and interactive dashboards.

## 📌 Features
- **Time Series Forecasting**: ARIMA, Linear Regression, and LSTM models
- **Technical Indicators**: Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Clustering**: K-Means for stock grouping
- **Interactive Visualization**: Plotly for interactive stock charts
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, Confusion Matrix for classification models



## 🚀 Usage
1. Load the dataset in `Stock_Analysis.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook step by step to analyze stock prices.
3. Modify parameters in models to test different forecasting techniques.
4. Visualize results interactively using Plotly.

## 📊 Results
- RMSE for Linear Regression: **~58.16**
- Improved Regression Model RMSE: **(~7)**
- ARIMA and LSTM-based forecasting implemented
- Clustering visualized with K-Means

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Implement real-time stock data fetching
- Improve LSTM accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
- Develop a web dashboard for stock analysis
